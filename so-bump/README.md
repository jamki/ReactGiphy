# James Kimpton - Bump Test

## Background
I spent around an hour-ish on and off on this project, unfortunately I had commitments over the weekend so didn't have much time to look over it.

What's been implemented:
* Hits the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) - âœ…
* By default it should load trending gifs - âœ…
* Shows the gifs in an infinite scrolling fashion - âœ…
* Is performant in its fetching and scrolling - More can be done for this, a debounce was added!
* Has a basic, clean layout (no crazy design skills needed) - Should look ok across breakpoints!

Not included:
* Include a search bar to search the GIPHY API for specific gifs - Set things up but didn't get around to this ðŸ˜¬
