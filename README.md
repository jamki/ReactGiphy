# BUMP Front-End Test

## About BUMP

Our mission at BUMP is to make all commerce social.

On BUMP users can build up their public profiles, follow & message anyone on the platform, list items they want to sell and buy products from other sellers.

Plus, we're working on introducing even more epic social features that allow kids to hang out and build their online identity with us which in turn drives transactions - we're a marketplace fuelled by a social network.

We're growing fast too. Last year we went through Y Combinator and we've just announced a $7.5M Series A round of funding following a $2M Seed Round in 2018 from leading names in venture capital including Kleiner Perkins, e.ventures and Y Combinator to redefine social shopping.

### Your Task:

* Hits the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)
* By default it should load trending gifs
* Include a search bar to search the GIPHY API for specific gifs
* Shows the gifs in an infinite scrolling fashion
* Is performant in its fetching and scrolling
* Has a basic, clean layout (no crazy design skills needed)
